In this Call Of Duty game, Captain Price is an SAS officer, and is in charge of mentoring "Soap" MacTavish. Price takes soap on a number of dangerous missions that almost make them meet with death. On the final mission of the first game of the Modern Warfare series, Price and soap are ambushed by russain terrorists, and ends off with Soap laying on the ground looking at what seems to be his mentors lifeless body. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_3">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>, Captain Price makes a surprising reappearance when Soap is sent to free captures prison in russia. One of those prisoners was a well and alive Captain Price. </p>
